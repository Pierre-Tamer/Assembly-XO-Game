# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game implemented in low level c and assembly 8086 languages
Developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using assembly language. This low-level programming project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how hardware and software interact. I learned to manage memory directly and handle processor instructions efficiently. Working on this project strengthened my knowledge of assembly language, as well as my ability to think critically about resource management and optimization in programming.
Steps to run the assembly game

1) Download emu8086
2) Create new file
3) Paste game code inside ./game.s
4) Click emulate
